### Step-by-Step Framework Guide

**Step 1:** Start with a clear folder structure that separates tests, locators, test data, and utilities.
**Step 2:** Use a base class to handle setup and teardown, logging, reporting, and browser config.
**Step 3:** Apply the Page Object Model (POM) to isolate UI logic from test logic so when the UI changes, your tests don't break.
**Step 4:** Integrate with tools like Allure/Extent Reports, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
**Step 5:** Make the framework data-driven so you can easily run tests across multiple sets of data.

pages/          - Page Object classes, one per UI page
utils/          - Reusable utilities: wait logic, Excel readers, screenshot capture
resources/
├── java/      - WebDriver setup, constants, configs
└── test/      - config.properties, test data, log configs
tests/          - Test classes structured by features/modules
reports/        - Extent/Allure test reports
screenshots/    - Auto-saved screenshots of failed tests
